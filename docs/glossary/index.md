title: Glossary

## API

Application Program Interfaces are methods for programs to exchange data without the involvement of humans. APIs often involve a schematic description of how the data looks like and where it needs to be sent. Today many APIs are based on [HTTP](#HTTP).

## Container

Containers are discussed in [lecture 4](../lectures/4-containers/index.md) and provide a way to package an application with its runtime requirement in a self-contained manner. Containers also provide limited security isolation.

## Docker

[Docker](https://docker.com) is one of the earliest modern containerization systems. Docker was largely responsible for promoting the immutable infrastructure concept in containers.

Docker also contains the Docker Swarm orchestrator, a very simple system to manage containers across multiple machines. 

Docker is discussed in [lecture 4](../lectures/4-containers/index.md) and [exercise 3](../exercises/3-containers/index.md).
